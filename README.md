# bdGameEngine
This is a learning project, with the end-result being a simple 2D RPG-Dungeon game.
At first the engine will entirely revolve around the planned game and making things as simple as possible.
The architecture is purely Windows-based.

The primary learning focus is understanding game/game-engine design-patterns, and practicing overall efficiency and algorithms.
To summarize, I wish to improve upon my fundamentals as a programmer with a somewhat-practical approach.

The only current requirement is the June 2010 DirectX SDK.
This is a bad old-habit, and will soon be ported to the newer version within the WindowsSDK.
This project does not plan on utilizing SDL, SFML, or similar libraries.  

#### Below is a list of key-concepts this practice will focus on:  
-General game and game-engine design patterns and programming practices  
-Improved memory and thread management  
-Thread-safe caching + improving general concurrency practices  
-Memory profiling  
-Interface classes / Virtual functions / Improving polymorphism techniques  
-DirectX9 rendering (Eventually DX12 and Vulkan as well)  
-Abstraction practices (Focused on WinAPI input management and Dx9 rendering)  
-Winsock programming, game networking design  
  
#### Below is a list of planned features:  
-2D renderer for sprites (DirectX support)  
-3D renderer for models (DirectX + Vulkan support)  
-Level/Map editor (2D sidescroller, 2D top-down, 3D isometric)  
-Save system  
-Settings system  
-User interface manager  
-GameObject manager  
-Entity manager (Players, NPCs, Items, Containern)  
-Memory manager + memory profiler  
-Networking builder (Supports P2P and Client-Server)  
-Basic combat system  

Most of my experience is in lower-level Windows programming, though I would like to improve upon my fundamentals and gain an understanding of game design-patterns.  
All suggestions are welcome.
